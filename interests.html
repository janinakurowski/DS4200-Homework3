          This page holds a few themes that guide my learning and practice. I like work that blends public health with
          data stories that serve people. I try to write notes that are calm and clear. I want readers to feel welcome
          even if a topic is new. I am drawn to simple charts that show just what the reader needs to see. I also care
          about trustworthy sources and the way we present them. Good citations invite readers to check claims and form
          their own view. I believe the best writing is kind to the reader and precise about methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          I keep a small area below where I can test simple visual ideas with JavaScript and D3. It is a sandbox for
          learning. The goal is not a perfect chart. The goal is to practice one small idea and to see how the code
          connects to what appears on the screen. I will update this over time. For now it is only a placeholder. If you
          are curious about the details or want to share a trick that helped you, please send a note through the contact
          section on the home page.
